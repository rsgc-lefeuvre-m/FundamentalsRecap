 Some new shape types and options have been added to the Canvas class.
 
 Use this new functionality, and your [knowledge of colour](http://russellgordon.ca/rsgc/2016-17/ics2o/HSB_Colour_Model_-_Summary_-_Swift_3.pdf), to reproduce this abstract version of the eBay logo:
 
 ![new_ebay_logo.png](new_ebay_logo.jpg "Overlapping Shapes Logo")
 
 Color and alpha (transparency) matter.
 
 Try reproducing this image for practice.
